# React Native: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...')

This repository demonstrates a common React Native error: 'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...')'.  This usually arises from incorrect component import ordering or premature component usage before module loading.

## Problem

The error message 'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...')' in React Native often points to a scenario where you're attempting to access properties of a component that hasn't been properly defined or loaded yet. This is common when components are imported incorrectly or used before their modules have finished loading.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the correct import order and waiting for component modules to fully load before using them.  This can often be addressed by restructuring imports or employing techniques like conditional rendering or asynchronous loading.
