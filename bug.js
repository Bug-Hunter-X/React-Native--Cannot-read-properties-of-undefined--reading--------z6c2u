This error occurs when you try to use a component before it has been defined.  This often happens when importing components in the wrong order or using them before the module has fully loaded.

```javascript
// Incorrect import order
import MyComponent from './MyComponent'; // MyComponent might not be fully loaded yet

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <MyComponent />
    </View>
  );
};
```
