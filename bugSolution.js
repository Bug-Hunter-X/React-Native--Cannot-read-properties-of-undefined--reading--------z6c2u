The solution is to ensure the component is fully loaded before trying to use it.  This can be done by checking if the component is defined before rendering it or restructuring the imports.

```javascript
// Correct import order
// Make sure MyComponent is fully loaded before the App component tries to render it
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      {MyComponent && <MyComponent />}
    </View>
  );
};
```

Alternatively, using techniques like asynchronous loading can also resolve the issue.
